            <p class="mt-2 text-justify"> <span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans:</span> The scope of var, let, and const
                refers to
                the extent of
                the code where these variables can be accessed
                or declared. var
                is function scoped, meaning it can only be accessed within the function where it is declared, or
                globally if it is
                declared outside any function. let and const are block scoped, meaning they can only be accessed within
                the block where
                they are declared, such as an if statement or a loop. const differs from let and var in that it cannot
                be reassigned a
                new value after declaration. For more information, you can visit these websites: <a

            <p class="mt-2 text-justify"><span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans:</span> null and undefined are two of the
                primitive values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a meaningful value. They
                can be used for different purposes depending on the context. null is used to indicate that a variable
                has been
                explicitly assigned no value, or that an object property or an array element does not exist. undefined
                is used to
                indicate that a variable has not been declared, or that an object property or an array element has not
                been assigned any
                value, or that a function parameter has not been provided, or that a function does not return any value.

            <h2 class="text-3xl">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-justify"><span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans:</span> REST API stands for
                Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a style of web API that
                follows certain design principles and conventions to allow applications and servers to communicate and
                exchange data
                using HTTP methods. A REST API typically exposes resources (such as data, content, media, etc.) through
                uniform resource
                identifiers (URIs) that can be accessed and manipulated by clients using HTTP methods such as GET, POST,
                PUT, PATCH,
                DELETE, etc. A REST API also supports different data formats for the request and response bodies, such
                as JSON, XML,
                HTML, etc. For more information, you can visit these websites:<a class="hover:text-blue-700"
